# Academic Plan

1. In the AI era, I believe it is important to develop abilities that are unique to humans, not just study by memorising books. That is why I want to study secondary school in Hong Kong.    
2. In the future:    
- I hope to study at a university in Hong Kong.    
    - It can give me a broader global view.        
    - The education system is more flexible.        
    - The undergraduate stage is very important for forming values and life goals, and I would like to stay within the Chinese cultural context.        
- For postgraduate study, I hope to go overseas to further broaden my horizons.    
- For my future career:    
    - As I gain more experience and my thinking becomes more mature, I will make my choice in the future.
    - By growing together with the development of the country, individuals can have more opportunities to succeed.
# 特长 Specialties
## 足球 Football
- 可以套上：
	- 团队精神，领导能力，锻炼观察，决策，判断力，为了目标而努力
	- Team spirit, leadership skills, the ability to observe, make decisions and judgments, and the determination to work hard towards a goal.
- 足球不光可以锻炼身体，还可以锻炼脑力，我要在场上分析形势，及时做出判断和决策，因为我技术好，指挥的也好，所以都大家都听我的。
- It not only makes me fit, but also trains my mind. On the field, I need to read the game, make quick judgments and decisions. Because I have good skills and can lead well, my teammates all listen to me. This sport helps me develop team spirit, leadership, as well as the abilities of observation, decision-making and judgment, and pushes me to work hard for goals.
## 素描 Sketching
- 我喜欢素描是因为，在我素描的时候，这一段时间是完全属于我的，我可以在这一段时间中沉下心来，听着我喜欢的音乐，在纸上画画，使我感到放松。
- I love sketching because when I do it, that time is all mine. I can calm down, listen to my favorite music and draw on paper. It makes me feel relaxed.
- 素描可以锻炼我的专注力（心流状态）在我考试的时候，也经常会有这种感觉。
- Sketching trains my focus (flow state)—a feeling I often get when I take exams too.
# 服务精神
## 班长
我从二年级开始，当了5年班长，是班里威望最高资历最深的班干部。我平时协助老师管理班级，帮助其他的班干部做好自己的工作。在周五的时候，我会在班会上总结班干部与班级一周以来的表现。

# Service Spirit
## Class Monitor
I have been a class monitor for five years, starting from Grade 2.  
I help my teacher manage the class and keep things in order.  
I also help other class leaders do their jobs well.  
Every Friday, I give a short weekly summary in our class meeting about how the class and class leaders did that week.

## Student Union — Vice Deputy of the Arts and Sports Team
I ran for this position because I wanted to challenge myself and improve my skills.

I also actively joined volunteer activities organized by the school.

## At Home
When we have guests at home, I help clean up after the visit.  
I do it together with my younger brother.  
Sometimes I joke that I can be a little lazy, but I still try my best to help.

# 遇到困难与解决方案

## Student Union Election
- The first challenge I faced was that I did not know how to write a resume for the election. I asked my parents for help.    
- The second challenge was that I was not clear about the rules and requirements of the election. I asked a school teacher for guidance.    
    - I tried my best to take every chance to ask questions about the election.        
    - I also went to his office to ask for advice on how to write my speech.        
    - In the end, I was successfully elected as a Student Union member.

- I have visited provincial-level museums in 11 places, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Chongqing, and Hong Kong.
	- **回忆一两件在博物馆看到的适合讲的事情！！**
- 在我学习了历史后，我便开始对历史十分感兴趣。我去了香港故宫博物院，还看了埃及博物展。了解了更多中国历史.
- After learning history in class, I became very interested in the subject. I visited the Hong Kong Palace Museum and also went to the Ancient Egypt exhibition. Through these visits, I learned more about Chinese history.

# 三个词形容自己
- 有领导力的，执行力强，发展均衡
## 领导力
足球：我会在场上分析形势，及时作出判断，并向队员发出指令。因为我的技术过硬，指挥的也好，所以他们都服我。
## 执行力
话剧比赛：排练的时候导演不在，没有负责的人带我们班排练。我就带着演员们一起排练。最后我们的话剧得了最佳创意奖。
## 发展均衡
学习体育样样行：从学期开始以来，我们班每个月的学术之星就一直是我。在体育与美术的方面我也是名列前茅。

# Three Words to Describe Me
- Leadership, Strong Execution, and Well-Rounded Development
## Leadership
In football, I analyze the situation on the field and make quick decisions.  
I give clear instructions to my teammates during the game.  
Because I have strong skills and lead well, my teammates trust and follow me.

## Strong Execution
During a drama competition, the director was not present during rehearsals, and no one was in charge.  
I stepped up and led the actors to practise together.  
In the end, our drama won the **Best Creativity Award**.

## Well-Rounded Development
I perform well in both academics and activities.  
Since the beginning of this term, I have been chosen as the **Academic Star** of my class every month.  
I also do very well in sports and art, and I am among the top students in these areas.

# 空闲时干什么 What I Do in My Free Time
## 打游戏 Playing Video Games
在平时周末的时候，我喜欢和弟弟一起打游戏，有些时候爸爸也会在边上看得入神。这是一个很好的消遣方法，可以让全家感到欢乐。
On weekends, I like to play video games with my younger brother.  
Sometimes my father also watches and becomes very interested.  
It is a good way to relax and brings happiness to our whole family.
## 读书 Reading （一定不能忘了读书）
拓宽眼界，学习课本之外的知识
I enjoy reading because it helps me broaden my horizons and learn knowledge beyond what is taught in textbooks.

**要补上具体的内容！！**

# 自我介绍

Good morning/afternoon, teachers. My name is Feng Yuze。我在东莞暨大港澳子弟学校读中一。

在小学，我连续担任了五年班长，在中一时，我竞选上了学生会干部，还踊跃参加了学校组织的义工活动。这些经历不仅教会我如何服务他人，更让我理解了责任的真正意义。
In primary school, I served as a class monitor for five consecutive years.  

In Year 7, I was successfully elected as a Student Union member and actively joined volunteer activities organised by the school.  
These experiences not only taught me how to serve others, but also helped me understand the true meaning of responsibility.

中一开学以来，我每周都是学术之星，平时还经常参加足球、羽毛球、飞盘、篮球等体育活动。
Since the start of Year 7, I have been selected as the **Academic Star** every week.  
In my free time, I often take part in sports such as football, badminton, ultimate frisbee, and basketball.

我积极承担家务，乐于动手实践。家里的家具就是我带着弟弟完成安装的。我还喜欢挑战独自组装的拼装难度高的模型，这极大地锻炼了我的耐心和专注力。
I actively help with household chores and enjoy hands-on work.  
The furniture at home was assembled by my younger brother and me.  
I also like to challenge myself by building difficult models on my own, which has greatly improved my patience and concentration.

我之所以渴望来香港学习，是源于我对AI时代的深入思考。我认为，既然人类在记忆和演算上无法与机器抗衡，我们就必须专注于发展人类独有的核心能力——那便是感知、表达和动手创造的能力。
I want to study in Hong Kong because of my deep thinking about the AI era.  
I believe that since humans cannot compete with machines in memory and calculation, we should focus on developing abilities that are unique to humans.  
These include perception, expression, and hands-on creativity.

我相信，香港东西方文化交融的特质，尤其是贵校多元化的学习环境，是帮助我培养这些未来能力最理想的土壤。我非常期待能有机会在这里，与优秀的师生共同成长。
I believe that Hong Kong’s blend of Eastern and Western cultures, especially your school’s diverse learning environment, is the ideal place for me to develop these future-ready abilities.  
I truly hope to have the opportunity to study here and grow together with excellent teachers and students.

谢谢各位老师。
Thank you, teachers.
