# Describe an impressive experiment

- Put an egg in water, and it sinks to the bottom.  Add some salt to the water, and the egg slowly floats up.
- At first, the egg is heavier than the water, so it sinks.  When we add salt, the salty water becomes heavier, and the egg floats up.
- This is the first experiment I didn’t understand, but I thought it was really amazing.
