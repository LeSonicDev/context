# 第一批改错题总结
---
## 一、时态 & 时间表达类错误

### 1. 现在完成时 ＋ since（从过去某一点到现在）

**核心规则：**

- 结构：**have / has + 过去分词**
    
- 常配：**since + 过去时间点 / 过去的动作**
    
- 表示「从过去某时一直持续到现在」。
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ I live in Hong Kong since I was ten.  
> ✅ I **have lived** in Hong Kong since I was ten.

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ She knows him since primary school.  
> ✅ She **has known** him since primary school.

---

### 2. for vs since（“一段时间” vs “起点”）

**核心规则：**

- **for + 一段时间**：for five years, for two months, for a long time
    
- **since + 时间点 / 过去的动作**：since 2019, since last year, since I was ten, since he joined the school
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ We have known each other **since five years**.  
> ✅ We have known each other **for five years**.

> ✗ My best friend Peter has known me **since three years**.  
> ✅ My best friend Peter has known me **for three years**.

3.（带 before 的复杂一点）

> ✗ She has taught us about nature **since two months** before the trip.  
> ✅ She **taught** us about nature **for** two months before the trip.  
> （这里既要 **for**, 又要用过去式，因为“before the trip”是过去一个完整结束的阶段）

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ Our English teacher has been in this school since ten years.  
> ✅ Our English teacher has been in this school **for** ten years.

---

### 3. 将来完成时：By + 将来时间点

**核心规则：**

- **By + 将来的具体时间点**（e.g. by the end of this week / by 2030）  
    → 常用 **will have + 过去分词** 表示「到那时之前就已经完成」。
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ By the end of this week, we **have prepared** everything for the party.  
> ✅ By the end of this week, we **will have prepared** everything for the party.

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ By next year, she **has finished** all her secondary school exams.  
> ✅ By next year, she **will have finished** all her secondary school exams.

---

## 二、名词可数性 & 主谓一致

### 4. 不可数名词不能加 -s（information / news / homework / feedback）

**核心规则：**

这些在英语里通常当作不可数名词，不加 -s：

- **information, news, homework, feedback, advice** 等
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ Before the trip, the teacher gave us many useful **informations** about hiking safely.  
> ✅ Before the trip, the teacher gave us **a lot of useful information** about hiking safely.

> ✗ The music teacher has given us a lot of useful **informations** about the singers and the songs.  
> ✅ The music teacher has given us a lot of useful **information** about the singers and the songs.

> ✗ There are a lot of **homeworks** for us to do this weekend.  
> ✅ There is a lot of **homework** for us to do this weekend.

> ✗ The school magazine team has collected a lot of **feedbacks** from the audience.  
> ✅ The school magazine team has collected a lot of **feedback** from the audience.

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ He gave me some useful **advices**.  
> ✅ He gave me some useful **advice**.

---

### 5. 不可数名词作主语时，用单数动词（news / information…）

**核心规则：**

- 不可数名词在语法上算“整体”，所以动词用 **单数**：
    
    - The news **is** surprising.
        
    - The information **is** important.
        

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ The news are really surprising to everyone in the office.  
> ✅ The **news is** really surprising to everyone in the office.

> ✗ The news about wild animals near the hill **are** not true.  
> ✅ The news about wild animals near the hill **is** not true.

> ✗ The good news **are** that our class band won the first prize.  
> ✅ The good news **is** that our class band won the first prize.

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ The latest information about the exam **are** on the notice board.  
> ✅ The latest information about the exam **is** on the notice board.

---

### 6. There is / are + 不可数名词：用 is

**核心规则：**

- there **is** + 单数名词 / 不可数名词
    
- there **are** + 复数可数名词
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ There **are** a lot of homeworks for us to do this weekend.  
> ✅ There **is** a lot of homework for us to do this weekend.

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ There **are** too much traffic on this road in the morning.  
> ✅ There **is** too much traffic on this road in the morning.

---

## 三、介词 & 固定搭配

### 7. good at / absent from / interested in

**核心规则：**

- be **good at** sth / doing sth
    
- be **absent from** school / class
    
- be **interested in** sth / doing sth
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ He is good **in** playing the piano.  
> ✅ He is good **at** playing the piano.

---

### 9. arrive at / arrive in / arrive home / arrive there（后面介词的选择）

**核心规则：**

- **arrive at + 小地方 / 具体地点**：arrive at the school / at the station
    
- **arrive in + 大地方 / 城市国家**：arrive in Hong Kong / in Japan
    
- **arrive home / arrive there**：后面**不加**介词
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✗ We **arrived the school** late and had to hand in our worksheets quickly.  
> ✅ We **arrived at the school** late and had to hand in our worksheets quickly.

（音乐节那篇，其实还有 “arrived to the computer room”，但他已经在新一轮做对了）

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ They arrived to the airport at 7 p.m.  
> ✅ They arrived **at** the airport at 7 p.m.

---

### 10. discuss（后面不能再加 about）

（顺带连着 information 不可数）

**再给一个同类型例题：**

> ✗ You can ask more help from your teacher after class.  
> ✅ You can **ask for more help** from your teacher after class.

---

## 四、冠词 the 的使用（特指、独一无二）

### 12. the air / the sun / the school website

**核心规则：**

- 当说的对象是**特定的**、**听说双方都知道是哪一个**，或是**独一无二**的事物时，常用 **the**：
    
    - the air（当地的空气）
        
    - the sun
        
    - the school website（本校网站）

---

**核心规则：**

- **very + 形容词原级**：very tall, very quiet, very interesting
    
- **much / a lot / far + 比较级**：much taller, a lot better, far more interesting
    

**他出错过的句子：**

> ✅ This question is **much easier** than that one.  
> ✅ 或：This question is **very easy**.

---

## 六、综合用法小结（可以给煜澤当“复习 checklist”）

你可以让他自己在本子上抄一份，只写标题＋一个自己挑的例句：

1. **现在完成时 + since**（I have lived here since…）
    
2. **for vs since**（for five years / since 2019）
    
3. **将来完成时：will have done + by…**

12. **the air / the sun / the school website**
    
13. **very + 原级；much + 比较级**
    

# 第二批改错题总结
---
## 1️⃣ enjoy / finish / avoid 等后接 V-ing

### 核心规则

一批动词后面接“动作”时，**习惯用 V-ing（动名词）而不是 to do**，常见的有：

> **enjoy, finish, avoid, mind, keep, suggest, practice, consider, imagine, risk…**

典型结构：

- enjoy **doing** sth.
    
- finish **doing** sth.
    
- avoid **doing** sth.
    
- keep **doing** sth.
    
- suggest **doing** sth.
    

中一～中三卷子最常考的是：

> **enjoy / finish / avoid + V-ing**

### 他出错过的句子

> ✗ Most of us enjoy **to work** on the project after school.  
> ✅ Most of us enjoy **working** on the project after school.

### 同类新例题（你可以让他自己先改）

> ✗ They finished **to write** the report last night.  
> ✅ They finished **writing** the report last night.

> ✗ You should avoid **to make** the same mistake again.  
> ✅ You should avoid **making** the same mistake again.

### 应试口诀

可以直接写在他错题本上：

> **看到 enjoy / finish / avoid 这几个动词，后面一律用 V-ing，不要用 to do。**

---

## 2️⃣ because vs so：不能 “Because…so…”

### 核心规则

中文喜欢说「因为……所以……」，  
但英文里 **because 和 so 不能同时做连接词**，只能选一个结构：

- **原因在前**：
    
    - **Because** the topic is very interesting, many students want to visit our booth.
        
- **结果在后**：
    
    - The topic is very interesting, **so** many students want to visit our booth.
        

> ✗ Because … **so** … → 这就是典型考点。

### 他出错过的句子

> ✗ **Because** the topic is very interesting, **so** many students want to visit our booth.  
> ✅ Because the topic is very interesting, many students want to visit our booth.  
> ✅ The topic is very interesting, so many students want to visit our booth.

（改错题里通常只能改一处，所以我们删 **so**。）

### 同类新例题

> ✗ Because it was raining heavily, so we stayed at home.  
> ✅ Because it was raining heavily, we stayed at home.  
> ✅ It was raining heavily, so we stayed at home.

### 应试口诀

> **句首用 Because，就不要再用 so；  
> 想用 so，前面就用普通陈述句，不要加 because。**

让煜泽看到 because 和 so 同时出现时，形成“条件反射”：  
👉 必有一处要删。

---

## 3️⃣ between / among：两者 & 三者以上的分配

### 核心规则（按考试标准）

传统语法（也是考试最爱考的）：

- **between**：两者之间
    
    - between **two** people / two places / two choices
        
- **among**：三者或以上“在……之中”
    
    - among three students
        
    - among all the classmates
        

虽然现代口语对这个限制变宽了，但**试卷仍然按旧规则出题**，所以我们也按旧规则来。

### 他出错过的句子

> ✗ The work was divided **between** three students in my group.  
> ✅ The work was divided **among** three students in my group.

### 同类新例题

> ✗ The sweets were shared **between** all the students in the class.  
> ✅ The sweets were shared **among** all the students in the class.

> ✅ The work was divided **between** Tom and Jerry.（两个人 → between）

### 应试口诀

> **two → between**  
> **three or more → among**
> 
> （看到人数 ≥3，优先改成 among。）

---

## 4️⃣ 介词 / 短语 + V-ing：responsible for checking…

### 核心规则

绝大多数**介词（in / on / at / for / before / after / without / by / instead of…）**  
以及一些**固定短语**后面，后接动词时要用 **V-ing**：

- be responsible **for checking** the wires
    
- thank you **for helping** me
    
- be busy **preparing** for the exam
    
- before **entering** the lab
    
- after **finishing** our homework
    
- without **saying** a word
    
- by **taking** a taxi
    
- instead of **playing** computer games
    

这是香港卷子喜欢考的“细水长流”型错误：**形式不难，但很容易忽略**。

### 他出错过的句子

> ✗ Mark is responsible for **check** all the wires before we turn on the robot.  
> ✅ Mark is responsible for **checking** all the wires before we turn on the robot.

（其实同一句里，before we turn on 里也可以写 before **turning** on the robot，这是再下一层的延伸。）

### 同类新例题

> ✗ She is busy **to prepare** for the test.  
> ✅ She is busy **preparing** for the test.

> ✗ Thank you for **help** me with my project.  
> ✅ Thank you for **helping** me with my project.

### 应试口诀

给煜泽一个简单可用的“雷达”：

> **看到介词 / 短语 + 动词原形，要提高警惕：  
> 大概率要把动词改成 V-ing。**
> 
> 尤其是：for / before / after / without / by 后面。

---

## 5️⃣ 间接问句用陈述语序（宾语从句）

### 核心规则

**直接问句**里，有倒装（助动词在前）：

- What **did** we learn from the experiment?
    
- Where **does** he live?
    
- Why **were** they late?
    

变成「某人问 / 知道 / 想知道……什么」时，就变成**间接问句（宾语从句）**，  
里面**不再用疑问句语序，而是回到“主语 + 谓语”**：

- Our teacher asked us **what we learned** from the experiment.
    
- I don’t know **where he lives**.
    
- She wondered **why they were late**.
    

规则可以拆成三步给他记：

1. 把外面那句加上：ask / tell / wonder / know / don’t know / explain…
    
2. 去掉 do / does / did 这类助动词（除非本来就需要）
    
3. 把语序变成：连接词（what / where / why / how…）+ **主语 + 谓语**
    

### 他出错过的句子

> ✗ Our teacher asked us **what did we learn** from the experiment.  
> ✅ Our teacher asked us **what we learned** from the experiment.

### 同类新例题

1. 从直接问句变到间接问句：
    

> 直接问句：Where did he go yesterday?

- ✗ I don’t know **where did he go yesterday**.
    
- ✅ I don’t know **where he went yesterday**.
    

2. 再一题：
    

> 直接问句：Why are they late?

- ✗ She wants to know **why are they late**.
    
- ✅ She wants to know **why they are late**.
    

### 应试口诀

> **间接问句 / 宾语从句里：  
> 连接词 + 主语 + 谓语，  
> 不要再“do / does / did + 主语 + 动词原形”那套疑问语序。**

你可以让他做一个“转化游戏”：  
把一些直接问句，全部改写成 “I don’t know… / He asked me…” 这类间接问句，训练语序。

---

## 总体复习建议（这 5 点怎么用在接下来一周）

可以让煜泽在错题本上单独开一页，写上标题：

> **「动词 + 动名词 / 不定式 & 连接词 & 介词」专题薄弱点**

下面列 5 行，每行写上：

1. enjoy / finish / avoid + V-ing
    
2. Because…so… → 只能二选一
    
3. two → between；three or more → among
    
4. 介词 / 短语 + V-ing（for / before / after / without / by…）
    
5. 间接问句 / 宾语从句用陈述语序（what we learned）

# Enjoy to do / doing

结论先说清楚：

> 在**现代标准英语、尤其是考试语法里**，  
> **“enjoy to do” 一般视为错误用法**，  
> 正确结构是：**enjoy doing sth.**

不是它有“另一种特别含义”，而是**绝大多数情况下就不该这么写**。下面我分层解释一下，方便你跟煜泽讲。

---

## 1. 标准考纲里的用法：只记一个——enjoy doing

中学考试（包括香港插班试）里，**enjoy 后面接动词，默认要求 V-ing**：

- I enjoy **reading** comic books.
    
- Most of us enjoy **working** on the project after school.
    
- He enjoys **playing** basketball with his friends.
    

像 like / love / hate 这些可以两种都用：

- like **to play** / like **playing**
    
- love **to read** / love **reading**
    

但 enjoy 在常规语法教学和考试里面，**只教、只考 “enjoy doing”**。  
所以刚才那句：

> ✗ Most of us enjoy **to work** on the project after school.

在任何正规试卷上，都算 **语法错**，必须改成：

> ✅ Most of us enjoy **working** on the project after school.

如果从**应试角度**给煜泽一句死记的话：

> **看到 enjoy + 动词 → 一律改成 V-ing。**  
> （考试不用犹豫，直接当“硬规则”。）

---

## 2. 有没有“enjoy to do”这回事？——理论上有，但不适合中学用

严谨一点说：在少量**旧式 / 个别地区口语**里，你偶尔会看到：

- I would enjoy to do that.
    

这种写法在语料库里确实有零星出现，但：

1. **频率非常低**
    
2. 多数被现代语法书标成 **non-standard / 不地道**
    
3. 学校试卷、教科书不会当成“正确选项”
    

所以对煜泽来说，记住一句就够了：

> 在学校和考试里，**“enjoy to do” 就当错，不要用。**

---

## 3. 容易混淆的合法结构：enjoy + 名词 + to do

这里有一个“看上去像 enjoy to do，其实结构不一样”的情况，你以后可能会在读物里看到：

- I enjoyed the chance **to work** with your team.
    
- They enjoyed the opportunity **to visit** the museum.
    

结构拆开是：

> enjoy + **名词**（the chance / the opportunity / the right / the privilege） + **to do**（这个不定式是修饰前面的名词）

而不是直接 enjoy to do。  
如果你把名词删掉，变成：

> ✗ I enjoyed to work with your team.

这在现代标准英语里就是不自然甚至错误的。

给你一个小测试，可以跟煜泽玩一下：

- ✅ I enjoyed **the chance to meet** new friends.
    
- ✗ I enjoyed **to meet** new friends.
    

问他：  
哪一个有“名词作桥梁”？哪一句是我们说的“不要写”的？

---

## 4. 和 like doing / like to do 的对比

你可能在帮孩子学时遇到这样的讲解：

- like / love / hate：
    
    - 可以 **doing**，也可以 **to do**，有时带一点语气差别（泛指习惯 vs 一次性选择）；
        
- enjoy：
    
    - **基本只用 doing**，不做这种细腻区分。
        

所以在教学和考试层面，我们不去玩“语义区别”的高难度，直接给孩子一个清晰的结论：

> ✅ like / love / hate：两种都可以（学校有时候会讲细微差别）  
> ✅ enjoy：**只要记 enjoy doing，其他写法一律当错**

---

## 5. 应试策略总结（可以直接说给煜泽听）

以后他看到 / 要写：

- ✗ enjoy to play
    
- ✗ enjoy to read
    
- ✗ enjoy to work
    

一律改为：

- ✅ enjoy **playing**
    
- ✅ enjoy **reading**
    
- ✅ enjoy **working**
    

**不要去想有没有“特别意思”**——在试卷上，这就是语法错误。

# To do / doing
---
先给你一个**一眼就能用的结论表**，再把细节展开。

## 一、结论总表（按应试优先级来记）

|动词|只能接 doing？|to do / doing 都可以？|考试里**建议优先用**哪种？|备注|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**enjoy**|✅ 是|❌ 基本不用 to do|**enjoy doing**|视为“硬规则”，考试直接当错误点来考|
|**like**|❌ 否|✅ 都可以|一般用 **like doing**（泛指习惯）|部分题会考语义差别|
|**love**|❌ 否|✅ 都可以|两个都常见，**love doing**更稳妥||
|**hate**|❌ 否|✅ 都可以|两个都行，考试不会太纠结||
|**prefer**|❌ 否|✅ 都可以|重点是**固定搭配结构**，不是单纯 to / doing|prefer doing A to doing B / prefer to do A rather than do B|

> **应试最实用记法：**
> 
> - **enjoy → 一律 + doing**
>     
> - like / love / hate → to do & doing 都对，不太会拿来做陷阱
>     
> - prefer → 重点记几条“整块搭配”，比纠结 to / doing 更实际
>     

---

## 二、逐个拆解说明

### 1. enjoy：只要记 enjoy doing 就够了

**语法习惯：**

- 标准现代英语里，**enjoy 后接动词，几乎只用 V-ing**
    
- 你在正规教材和考试里基本不会看到 “enjoy to do” 被当作正确答案
    

**常见结构：**

- enjoy **doing** sth.
    
    - I enjoy **reading** novels.
        
    - Most of us enjoy **working** on the project after school.
        

**考试策略（给煜泽的）：**

> 看到 **enjoy + 动词**，如果不是 **V-ing**，就当错，直接改成 **doing**。

---

### 2. like：to do / doing 都对，但含义略有侧重

**两种都可以：**

- like **doing** sth.
    
- like **to do** sth.
    

**大致语感差别（简单给孩子讲的版本）：**

- **like doing**：
    
    - 常指“**平时、习惯上**喜欢做这件事”，轻微“爱好”的味道
        
    - I like **playing** football.（我这个人爱踢球）
        
- **like to do**：
    
    - 更像“觉得这样做是个好选择 / 适合此场合”，有时偏“选择、习惯安排”
        
    - I like **to get up** early on weekdays.（我倾向/习惯平日早起）
        

**应试建议：**

- 一般语法题：两个都不会当错
    
- 如果是**一般性的爱好、习惯**，用 **like doing** 更自然、更保险
    

**例句对比：**

- She likes **swimming**.（她爱游泳）
    
- She likes **to swim** in the morning.（她倾向/习惯早上去游泳）
    

---

### 3. love：和 like 类似，to do / doing 都可

**结构：**

- love **doing** sth.
    
- love **to do** sth.
    

大部分场合语义差别不大，更多是语气上的轻微不同，不是考试重点。

**例句：**

- I love **playing** the piano.
    
- I love **to play** the piano in the evening.
    

**应试策略：**

- 两个都可以，出选择题一般不会考这个细微差别
    
- 你要刻意统一，就让孩子优先用：**love doing**（和 enjoy / like 做一条线）

### 4. hate：用法与 like / love 类似

**结构：**

- hate **doing** sth.
    
- hate **to do** sth.
    

**例句：**

- I hate **waiting** in a long queue.
    
- I hate **to wait** for people who are always late.
    

语感上也可以有一点“习惯 vs 一次性情况”的区别，但对于中一插班这种水平，**不会细扣**。

**应试策略：**

- to do / doing 都行，不是高频陷阱点
    
- 如果你想统一风格：可以多用 **hate doing**

### 5. prefer：关键在“整套搭配”，不是单独 to / doing

prefer 是里面**最适合考题目**的一个，因为搭配结构多，容易出错。

常见几种你们需要掌握的：

#### 5.1 prefer A to B / prefer doing A to doing B

- prefer **A to B**（名词）：
    
    - I prefer **tea to coffee**.
        
- prefer **doing A to doing B**：
    
    - I prefer **reading books to watching TV**.
        

> 考试常见错误陷阱：  
> ✗ prefer A **than** B  
> ✅ prefer A **to** B

#### 5.2 prefer to do A rather than (do) B

- prefer **to do A rather than (do) B**
    
    - I prefer **to stay** at home rather than (go) shopping.
        

这里有两种做法考试会认：

- I prefer **to stay** at home rather than **to go** shopping.
    
- I prefer **to stay** at home rather than **go** shopping.
    

#### 5.3 prefer doing vs prefer to do

两种都有：

- I prefer **walking** to taking the bus.
    
- I prefer **to walk** to take the bus.（不太自然，通常会改句式）
    

所以**实战建议是**：  
不要让孩子纠结“prefer 后面直接接 to do 还是 doing”，  
而是让他牢记：

> - prefer **A to B**
>     
> - prefer **doing A to doing B**
>     
> - prefer **to do A rather than (do) B**
>

## 三、给你一个「一眼看懂」的简化版总结（适合写在错题本首页）

你可以直接照抄给煜泽：

1. **enjoy → enjoy doing**
    
    - enjoy playing / enjoy reading / enjoy working
        
2. **like / love / hate → 两种都对**
    
    - like doing / like to do
        
    - love doing / love to do
        
    - hate doing / hate to do
        
    
    一般说习惯、爱好，用 doing 更顺口。
    
3. **prefer → 记整套搭配**
    
    - prefer A **to** B
        
    - prefer **doing A to doing B**
        
    - prefer **to do A rather than (do) B**
