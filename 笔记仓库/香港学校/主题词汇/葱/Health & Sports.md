These practices help everyone **maintain emotional balance** and **strike a balance between study and exercise**.

Exercise contributes equally to our body and mind. When students **take part in various sports disciplines** and **train regularly**, they **build up stamina and flexibility**, **enhance physical fitness**, and **burn off excess calories**. Before each session, they should warm up properly to avoid injuries. Those who **represent the school in inter-school competitions** learn to **demonstrate true sportsmanship**, **break their personal records**, and **develop perseverance and resilience**. Such experiences **cultivate self-discipline and determination**, preparing them for future challenges.

Team sports also **foster team spirit and cooperation**. Through training, we **build mutual respect among teammates**, **develop leadership and communication skills**, and **strengthen friendships through shared goals**. These qualities inspire others to **adopt healthy habits** and live positively.

**While academic success is important, mental and physical well-being should never be overlooked. Only by striking a balance between study and exercise can we achieve holistic growth.** In short, **leading a healthy and active life enables us to stay energetic, confident, and ready to face challenges ahead.**
