# 社会与价值 / 多元与接纳

**Building an Inclusive Campus**

When our school first welcomed a new wave of students from different regions, we realised that real **diversity**（多样性） is not a slogan but a daily practice. The heart of inclusion is **acceptance**（接纳；认同）—the willingness to listen before we judge. Too often, invisible **prejudice**（偏见） grows when classmates sit only with the familiar and activities become a **segregated**（隔离的） **environment**（环境） where newcomers watch from the edge. To change this, we started with language and **cultural**（文化的） exchange circles, reminding everyone that our school’s **ethos**（风气；理念） is respect, curiosity, and fairness.

At first, a few students were **reluctant**（不情愿的） to **participate**（参与） in mixed-group projects. Some feared they would be misunderstood; others worried about making mistakes. We addressed this directly: mentors modelled how to **project**（投射；展现） confidence and empathy in discussions, and teachers redesigned tasks so that every learner could contribute. We are **grateful**（感激的） for the student leaders who noticed each **obstacle**（障碍）—from timetable clashes to shy personalities—and quietly solved them. Over time, assemblies highlighted success stories and reminded us that, **regardless of**（不管；无论） background or accent, everyone has something to teach.

Inclusion also means fairness when problems arise. If an **accusation**（指控） of **prejudice**（偏见） appears online, we investigate carefully rather than simply **deny**（否认；拒绝给予） it. We discuss why **destructive**（破坏性的） comments harm trust, and how to rebuild it with honest reflection. Likewise, we learn that authorities may **deny**（否认；拒绝给予） a **visa**（签证） for reasons beyond a student’s control; our response is practical support, not blame. True **acceptance**（接纳；认同） grows when policies protect dignity and daily habits reflect kindness.

Today, our corridors feel different. Group work mixes languages and interests; performances weave **cultural**（文化的） stories from many homes; classrooms are designed so no one feels **segregated**（隔离的）. This is what **diversity**（多样性） looks like when it moves from posters to practice: a living **ethos**（风气；理念） that helps every learner **participate**（参与）, overcome each **obstacle**（障碍）, and **project**（投射；展现） their best selves—**regardless of**（不管；无论） where they began.

# 学校与学习 / 教育科技

**From Data to Growth: A Smart Classroom Playbook**

At the start of each term, we run a short **diagnostic**（诊断性的） **assessment**（评估） for every class. With learning **analytics**（数据分析） and an **automated**（自动化的） feedback tool, teachers see patterns early and support students before small problems grow. Teachers **translate**（翻译；转化） data into action plans.

In **algebra**（代数）, we design tasks that **scaffold**（（教育）支架式支持） the new **concept**（概念） step by step. The lesson is **interactive**（互动的）: students **collaborate**（合作） at the board, **relate**（联系；涉及；共鸣） formulas to real-life prices, and **adapt**（适应；改编） methods when they meet a challenge. Low-cost digital **equipment**（设备） lets them test ideas and **detect**（侦测；察觉） patterns quickly. As confidence grows, we **broaden**（拓宽） their **horizons**（眼界；视野） beyond drills by asking them to explain why the method works and where else it applies.

We also teach that talent is not **innate**（天生的）; progress comes from practice within **finite**（有限的） time and smart strategies. Clear rubrics reduce **subjective**（主观的） grading, and reflection conferences check how learners **perceive**（感知；看待） the process. When the plan is followed, students **accomplish**（完成；实现） goals earlier, which is deeply **rewarding**（有回报的；有成就感的） for everyone.

Finally, we review the data to refine lessons and homework length because the findings have direct **implications**（影响；启示） for workload and pacing. Used with care, technology doesn’t replace great teaching—it amplifies it.

# 艺术与文化 / 创造力

**Making Art, Making Sense**

During Arts Week, we discovered that **inspiration**（灵感；启发） is not a lightning strike but a habit of attention. Creativity looks less like a mysterious **phenomenon**（现象） and more like careful practice that even non-experts can learn. While stories often worship solitary **genius**（天才；卓越才能）, our rehearsals showed that teams transform **familiar**（熟悉的） moments—childhood songs, street sounds, family stories—into something **extraordinary**（非凡的） when each member contributes.

Across the **discipline**（学科；纪律） of music, drama, and design, every club works as an **entity**（实体；个体） with clear roles: writers sketch ideas, actors test scenes, musicians shape rhythm. We **channel**（引导；把（精力/情绪）导入） nerves into drafts and feedback cycles so that vague feelings **manifest**（显现；表明） as sketches, lines, and melodies. In artist statements, students **construct**（建构；构建） arguments about purpose—why this image matters now—and support them with evidence from technique and context.

By opening the studio doors, we learned that being **talented**（有天赋的） helps but is not enough; what finally gives a piece **substance**（实质；内容） is revision. The mural outside the library became a **monumental**（巨大的；重要的） timeline of our neighbourhood, layering oral history with bold colour. Its size impresses, but its **substance**（实质；内容） lies in the stories it preserves and the questions it raises. In this way, Arts Week turned everyday details into shared meaning—proof that creativity is a process anyone can practise, not a prize reserved for **genius**（天才；卓越才能） alone.

# 科学与健康 / 感官与人体

**The Science of Feeling and Focus**

Before a big match or exam, many students notice a surge of **adrenaline**（肾上腺素） that sharpens attention but also makes hands shake. This is a normal **reaction**（反应） driven by **hormones**（激素） preparing the body for challenge. In PE, we learn that moderate exercise releases **endorphins**（内啡肽）, natural chemicals that lift mood and **counteract**（抵消；对抗） stress. After running a few laps, worries fade because those chemicals change how we feel pain and pleasure.

Learning itself is shaped by **sensory**（感官的） input. A quiet classroom, clear slides, and varied textures create **stimulation**（刺激；激活） that helps memory. Yet too much noise can **magnify**（放大） anxiety; it is like turning up every channel until the mind cannot choose. Our teachers design activities across multiple **dimensions**（维度；方面）—visual, auditory, and kinesthetic—so each student can engage in a way that fits the task.

Science club turns feelings into data. We test **reaction**（反应） time with simple apps and try to **reproduce**（再现；复制） the results under different conditions: after stretching, after coffee, and after deep breathing. The numbers show that calm often beats panic. We also discuss online health claims and our own **vulnerability**（脆弱性） to clickbait. A dramatic headline can **magnify**（放大） risk in our imagination, so we compare evidence and practise slow thinking.

In the end, well-being is not luck; it is a system we can design. By balancing **stimulation**（刺激；激活） with rest, using movement to trigger **endorphins**（内啡肽）, and building routines that **counteract**（抵消；对抗） stress, we control more of our mind–body **dimensions**（维度；方面） than we realise. When we accept that **hormones**（激素） influence focus, and we learn to **reproduce**（再现；复制） helpful habits, school becomes a laboratory where science explains why confidence grows.

# 运动与风险 / 成长心态

**Safer Courage, Smarter Growth**

On Sports Day, some students chase the **thrill**（刺激；兴奋） of big jumps and fast wheels, while others worry these stunts are **controversial**（有争议的）. In videos, extreme sports have become a media **genre**（（艺术）体裁） that glorifies risk, but at school we must define courage differently.

Before any event, coaches do **meticulous**（一丝不苟的） checks; we **permit**（允许；许可） only tested procedures and trained participants, and remove **unnecessary**（不必要的） hazards. A first-aid team stands by to handle any **injury**（伤害；受伤） so excitement never turns into regret.

Preparation helps students **muster**（鼓起（勇气/力量）） steady nerves and see that progress is built from **ordinary**（普通的） habits. Teams **undergo**（经历；接受） drills, set realistic targets, and review **subsequent**（随后的） times and distances to map **complications**（并发；复杂问题）—like fatigue or weather—that affect performance. Even with planning, small mistakes are **inevitable**（不可避免的）, so we learn to adjust calmly.

Coaches also explain why risk can feel **addictive**（令人上瘾的）: the applause-and-dopamine loop. One accident is a **sobering**（令人清醒的；发人深省的） lesson that reminds us to **ponder**（思考；沉思） choices together and focus on **potential**（潜力；可能性）—to improve technique, to support teammates, and to enjoy sport safely.

# 职业与经济 / 创业与创新

**Inventing Our Future: Startups at School**

When we discuss career planning, we remind students that labour-market **demand**（需求；要求） does not **necessarily**（必然地；不一定） reward exam tricks alone. Many **white-collar**（白领的） roles now value teamwork, data literacy, and problem-solving more than rote memory. Our entrepreneurship module turns projects into prototypes so learners see how ideas meet real **demand**（需求；要求）.

To widen access, the school launched a pilot for **underserved**（资源不足的（群体/地区）） neighbourhoods. Teams can apply for a tiny **loan**（贷款；借贷） to buy materials, while mentors from different **regional**（地区的） industries visit after class. Workshops cover market research, budgeting, and how to read contracts; they also explain that start-ups offer no **guarantee**（保证；担保） of profit, only a fair chance to test hypotheses.

Along the way, we teach professional **norms**（规范；常态）—clear disclosures, ethical sourcing, honest marketing—so that every student can act like an **entrepreneur**（企业家） with integrity. Some ideas that serve new migrants or street vendors were once **stigmatised/stigmatized**（受污名化的） as “too small”; now we treat them as live case studies for inclusive growth. **Ultimately**（最终；归根结底）, the goal is not just to make money but to create value: solutions that improve daily life, build confidence, and prepare graduates for changing work.

# 全球与文化素养

**Bridging Worlds with Cultural Literacy**

Our global-studies club treats culture as a living conversation. One week we read a scene by a **playwright**（剧作家） from Nairobi; the next, we watch a **documentary**（纪录片） about migrant chefs in Hong Kong. These choices are not random—we look for **contemporary**（当代的；现代的） voices and **prestigious**（有声望的） festivals that highlight new ideas without ignoring local roots. To be **plain**（明显的；朴素的）, cultural literacy is not trivia; it is the habit of listening.

Still, there is always the **temptation**（诱惑） to stereotype. We counter it by asking **appropriate**（适当的） questions and citing sources, so curiosity never turns **arrogant**（傲慢的）. Student editors **embed**（嵌入；融入） context boxes—maps, timelines, a relevant **proverb**（谚语）—beside each article, helping readers see how a dish, a dance, or a poem carries memory across borders.

Careers matter, too. A **freelance**（自由职业的/者） alum shares how cross-cultural skills win clients: greeting people in their language, negotiating tone, and giving **courageous**（勇敢的） feedback when a design misuses symbols. Our most **enthusiastic**（热情的；积极的） members practise short interviews after screenings, noticing how filmmakers frame questions and whose voices are missing.

In the end, cultural literacy is a discipline of respect: choose **appropriate**（适当的） language, resist the **temptation**（诱惑） to assume, and be **courageous**（勇敢的） enough to revise your view. Do this, and you will not just pass exams—you will join the global conversation with care and confidence.

# 通用学术工具词

**Thinking Like a Scholar: An Academic Toolkit**

In a post-pandemic classroom, we remind ourselves that a **virus**（病毒） changed study habits worldwide; **currently**（目前；当前） we are rebuilding routines that are both humane and demanding. When a claim online sounds shocking, we say **presumably**（据推测） it is true only after evidence, because certainty without proof is an **exaggeration**（夸张；夸大）. Good readers do not just **consume**（消耗；消费；看/读） headlines; they trace sources, compare methods, and note limits.

Our writing policy is simple: teachers **propose**（提出；建议） clear steps—planning, drafting, citation—so no one slips into **plagiarism**（抄袭；剽窃） under deadline pressure. If we do make mistakes, we learn rather than merely **regret**（后悔；遗憾） them, and we do not ask for **lenient**（宽松的；宽大的） grading without improvement. Instead, we try to **persuade**（说服） the reader with reasons and data. In reflections, students **attribute**（归因于；属性） progress to practice and feedback, not luck, and they begin to **radiate**（流露；散发） quiet confidence.

The best lessons are **transformative**（变革性的）: they change how we see problems and what we can do about them. Debate club tracks how ideas travel across **civilizations**（文明） and centuries, showing that logic and empathy survive fashion. To our great **delight**（使高兴；高兴）, study does not drain joy; it builds **resilience**（韧性；复原力） by teaching us to fail safely, revise bravely, and try again.

# 高命中习语/固定表达

**A Festival of Voices: Idioms for Real-Life Problem Solving**

Our student council planned a multicultural festival **in the wake of**（随着…之后） last year’s quiet campus. Volunteer numbers are **on the rise**（正在上升）, yet some F.1 newcomers still felt **a fish out of water**（格格不入）. To **break the ice**（打破僵局）, a music club opened with a mash-up of folk songs. One coder admitted he was **head over heels**（深陷（爱河）） for theatre after a single rehearsal—proof that curiosity multiplies when we welcome beginners.

Logistics were **a tough nut to crack**（难题）: the gym, permits, sound checks, and food stalls. When a debate flared about noise, one prefect **hit the nail on the head**（一针见血） by pointing out that our map, not the music, was confusing. Critics who blamed the performers were **barking up the wrong tree**（找错对象/方向）; the real issue was signage. We redrew routes and promised to **play it by ear**（见机行事） if rain came. Another member nearly **upset the apple cart**（打乱计划） by moving the start time without notice; we fixed it and worked **tooth and nail**（拼命地；不遗余力） to update every poster. If online comments turned harsh, we chose to **turn the other cheek**（以德报怨；不计较） and reply with facts and kindness rather than fuel the fire.

Event day proved how momentum builds. By noon, the street-dance team was **in the zone**（状态极佳；进入心流）, while a sudden venue change made everyone groan—**on second thought**（转念一想）, the hall’s acoustics were better, **a blessing in disguise**（因祸得福）. A historian from a local museum—who visits **once in a blue moon**（千载难逢；很少）—dropped by and praised student booths as **a stepping stone**（垫脚石） to future internships. We reminded ourselves never to **take volunteers for granted**（视为理所当然）, because their patience kept the schedule steady even when we were **on the verge of**（濒临；即将） running late.

Looking back, the storyline shifted from doubt to confidence: when plans twist and **the plot thickens**（情节更扑朔迷离）, teams that listen, adapt, and support one another turn a school event into a shared lesson in citizenship.

# 伸展30词

**Designing a Civic Lab: Stretching Language, Expanding Minds**

When rumours **proliferate**（激增） on campus channels, a chorus of **disembodied**（脱离实体的） opinions can drown out facts, while a few **flamboyant**（浮华张扬的） influencers push **vaunted**（被吹捧的） “quick fixes.” Our debate society decided to **conceive**（构想；设想） something more **audacious**（大胆的；无畏的） yet careful: a student-run Civic Lab whose **foremost**（最重要的；首要的） goal is to **calibrate**（校准；调整） our fact-checking routines within clear **parameters**（参数；范围）. We invited a **pre-eminent**（卓越的；顶尖的） media-literacy **practitioner**（从业者；实务者） to map **consequential**（重要的；有深远后果的） decision points—what to flag, how to annotate, when to wait—so the project builds intellectual **buoyancy**（浮力；（市场）回升） rather than fear. The plan also reaches students on the **periphery**（边缘；外围） of school life, whose voices often **linger**（逗留；挥之不去） unheard in meetings.

Progress wasn’t easy. The schedule was **gruelling**（使精疲力竭的）, and we often **lament**（悲叹；哀悼） how **entrenched**（根深蒂固的） myths resist evidence. Some posts used **conspicuous**（显眼的；惹人注意的） headlines about **heinous**（极其恶劣的） crimes to demand instant online **retribution**（报应；惩罚）; our handbook now warns of **attendant**（伴随的） risks—rushed judgement, doxxing, and harm to victims. In writing workshops, we study how selective statistics can **foreshadow**（预示；铺垫） a biased conclusion and why a **maverick**（特立独行者/的） voice is valuable only when it tests ideas, not people. The **irony**（反讽；讽刺） is clear: tools that promise to connect us can isolate us unless we use them with purpose.

Then **serendipity**（机缘巧合） helped. A parent journalist shared **abundant**（大量的；充裕的） open datasets; a coder built a dashboard; an artist redesigned prompts so the process would **culminate**（以…告终；达到顶点） in a public showcase, not a closed report. We don’t claim to **eradicate**（根除；消灭） misinformation, but we do aim to leave a **legacy**（遗产；遗留影响） of habits: slow reading, sourced claims, and kind corrections. If those habits **linger**（逗留；挥之不去） after graduation, the Lab will have earned its place—not as a **vaunted**（被吹捧的） gadget, but as a thoughtful practice that keeps learning afloat.
