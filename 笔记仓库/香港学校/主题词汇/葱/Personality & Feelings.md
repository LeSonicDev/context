### **Understanding Personalities and Feelings**

_(约310词，正式文体，Band 1水准)_

At school, we meet people with different personalities. Some are **optimistic** and always see the bright side of life, while others are **pessimistic** and easily lose hope. My best friend, Jason, is one of the most **diligent**, **industrious**, and **conscientious** students I know. He is **responsible**, **reliable**, and always **grateful** for every opportunity. As a **compassionate** and **considerate** person, he treats everyone with kindness and respect.

Unlike some **arrogant** or **selfish** students who only think of themselves, Jason is **humble**, **generous**, and **sincere**. He’s also **ambitious**, **determined**, and **confident** when facing challenges. Whenever we feel **anxious** or **frustrated** about exams, he stays **relaxed** and encourages us to stay **enthusiastic** and **open-minded**.

However, not everyone is perfect. Some of our classmates can be **stubborn**, **impatient**, or even **careless** in their work. A few are **dishonest** or **moody**, while others become **depressed** or **disappointed** when they fail. Instead of making them feel **embarrassed**, Jason often helps them **cope with** their problems and reminds them to stay **independent**, **creative**, and **courageous**.

He also believes in teamwork. We can always **count on** him, and he knows how to **get along with** everyone. He truly **looks up to** our teachers and never **makes fun of** others. Even when others lose patience, he can **put up with** their behaviour.

Jason is truly a role model. He’s always **proud of** his classmates’ progress and often says we should all take pride in being **loyal**, **respectful**, and **responsible for** our actions. Whenever I’m **in a good mood**, I think it’s because I have such an inspiring friend. Even when I occasionally **lose my temper**, I remember his words: _“Stay kind, stay strong, and stay humble.”_

## ✍️ **How Personality Affects Our Relationships and Success**

_(约 320 词，含全部高阶搭配)_

Personality shapes the way we think, act, and build relationships. A person who has a **positive attitude towards life** and shows **great perseverance** is more likely to succeed. Students who **possess leadership qualities** and **take initiative** in class often inspire others. Those who are **open to new ideas** and have an **independent mind** tend to make creative decisions and influence their peers positively.

In school, I have met many people with different personalities. Some are **committed to** their goals and **devoted to their studies**, while others **lack self-confidence** or **suffer from mood swings**. I try to **set a good example for others** by staying **responsible** and **showing respect for others’ opinions**. Even when I feel **under pressure** before an exam, I take a deep breath to **regain self-control** instead of losing my temper.

Good relationships also depend on emotional intelligence. True friends **stand by each other through thick and thin** and **build mutual trust**. We can **count on** one another for help, **look up to** our seniors, and **express gratitude** to those who guide us. Being able to **put up with** people’s weaknesses shows maturity. When someone feels **heartbroken** or **disappointed**, offering comfort demonstrates empathy and compassion.

On the other hand, those who **act selfishly**, **have a short temper**, or are **too stubborn to listen to others** often damage friendships. Success is not only about talent but also about attitude. If we stay **optimistic**, **open-minded**, and **willing to learn from our mistakes**, we will earn respect and trust. Personality does not just affect how far we go academically—it determines what kind of person we become.
