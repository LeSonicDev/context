## 🏫 **My Secondary School Life**

_(共约290词 — 包含前表所有高阶词汇)_

My **secondary school life** has been both inspiring and demanding. Our **curriculum** is carefully designed by dedicated **educators** who value not only knowledge but also **self-discipline** and **good conduct**. Each **class schedule** is packed with engaging lessons, and every **instructor** motivates us to strive for excellence.

Apart from regular lessons, we often work on **collaborative projects** that require teamwork and creativity. We also deliver **oral presentations** to strengthen our **public speaking** skills. These **assignments** and **coursework** allow us to apply what we have learnt beyond textbooks. Our **academic performance** and **attainment** are evaluated through various **assessments** and **evaluations**, and the **progress report** helps us understand our strengths and weaknesses.

During **recess**, my **peers** and **fellow students** gather in the **auditorium** or the library. Sometimes, we discuss upcoming **extracurricular activities** or rehearse for **inter-school contests** and debate **championships**. As a **student leader** in the English **Society**, I help plan the **annual celebration**, the **open day**, and even a **charity fair** to raise funds for the elderly.

Our **school head**, also known as the **headmaster**, believes that school is not just about grades but about character. He often reminds us to **maintain good relationships with** others, to **lend support** to our classmates, and to take pride in our **school attire**, which follows a strict **dress code**.

From **educational excursions** and **study tours** to classroom learning, my school life has been filled with purpose. Though it is challenging, every experience at this **institution** shapes me into a responsible, confident, and compassionate individual ready for the future.
