## 🏫 **My School Life**

At my school, a well-balanced **curriculum** together with a clear **timetable** makes learning organised and efficient. Every morning, we have an **assembly**, and sometimes we gather in the **assembly hall** for special events. The school **facilities** are excellent, from the library to the playground, and we have lunch in the **canteen**. Besides lessons, there are plenty of **extracurricular** activities which require good **discipline** and being **punctual** for classes. Teachers often give small **rewards** to students who behave well and study hard.

Most of my classmates are **diligent**, **motivated**, and **attentive**. We are encouraged to be **independent** learners and are always **curious** about new knowledge. Everyone is **responsible** for their duties and **ambitious** in their studies. We are **respectful** to our teachers and **obedient** in class. Group work is always smooth because everyone is **cooperative**.

We often **participate in** various school events. During the English Week, we **perform** a short drama; on Sports Day, we **compete** in different races; in the library, I **volunteer** to help younger students. Last month, our class **organised** a charity fair to raise money for the poor. I was chosen to **represent** our school in a writing competition. The teachers said that active **participation** could help us grow in confidence. During preparation, I worked hard to **revise** all the key points and **submit** my homework on time. I always remember to **hand in homework** properly. Finally, I received an **achievement** award, and I am truly **proud of** myself.

In my daily study, I always **pay attention to** what the teacher says and try my best to **make progress**. I **get along with my classmates** very well. As a class monitor, I know I must **have a sense of responsibility** and always **show respect for** my teachers and schoolmates. I also try to be on time so that I won’t **be punished for** being late. Next week, there will be an inter-school exchange programme, and I really **look forward to** it. I will certainly **take part in** new projects, **make progress**, and achieve even greater **achievements** for my school.
