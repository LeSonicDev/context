## 🏫 **My School Life（我的校园生活）**

At my school, a well-balanced **curriculum（课程）** together with a clear **timetable（时间表）** makes learning organised and efficient. Every morning, we have an **assembly（早会/集会）**, and sometimes we gather in the **assembly hall（礼堂）** for special events. The school **facilities（设施）** are excellent, from the library to the playground, and we have lunch in the **canteen（饭堂）**.  
Besides lessons, there are plenty of **extracurricular（课外的）** activities which require good **discipline（纪律）** and being **punctual（准时的）** for classes. Teachers often give small **rewards（奖励）** to students who behave well and study hard.

Most of my classmates are **diligent（勤奋的）**, **motivated（有学习动力的）**, and **attentive（专心的）**.  
We are encouraged to be **independent（独立的）** learners and are always **curious（好奇的）** about new knowledge.  
Everyone is **responsible（有责任感的）** for their duties and **ambitious（有抱负的）** in their studies.  
We are **respectful（尊重人的）** to our teachers and **obedient（听话的）** in class.  
Group work is always smooth because everyone is **cooperative（乐于合作的）**.

We often **participate in（参加）** various school events. During the English Week, we **perform（表演）** a short drama; on Sports Day, we **compete（参赛）** in different races; in the library, I **volunteer（做义工）** to help younger students.  
Last month, our class **organised（组织）** a charity fair to raise money for the poor.  
I was chosen to **represent（代表）** our school in a writing competition.  
The teachers said that active **participation（参与）** could help us grow in confidence.  
During preparation, I worked hard to **revise（复习）** all the key points and **submit（上交）** my homework on time.  
I always remember to **hand in homework（交功课）** properly.  
Finally, I received an **achievement（成就）** award, and I am truly **proud of（为……感到骄傲）** myself.

In my daily study, I always **pay attention to（专心于）** what the teacher says and try my best to **make progress（取得进步）**.  
I **get along with classmates（与同学相处融洽）** very well.  
As a class monitor, I know I must **have a sense of responsibility（有责任感）** and always **show respect for（表示尊重）** my teachers and schoolmates.  
I also try to be on time so that I won’t **be punished for（因……受罚）** being late.  
Next week, there will be an inter-school exchange programme, and I really **look forward to（期待）** it.  
I will certainly **take part in（参加）** new projects, **make progress（取得进步）**, and achieve even greater **achievements（成就）** for my school.

## 💖 **My Personality and Feelings（我的个性与情感）**

Everyone has a different **personality（性格）**, and I believe mine has both strengths and weaknesses.  
I am a **confident（自信的）** and **responsible（有责任感的）** student who always tries to finish my homework on time.  
I am also quite **sociable（善于交际的）**, and I can **get along with others（与他人相处融洽）** easily.  
My friends say I am **considerate（体贴的）** and **generous（慷慨的）** because I often share my snacks and help classmates who need support.

I enjoy trying new things and coming up with interesting ideas.  
When I set a goal, I stay **determined（有决心的）** and **self-disciplined（自律的）**.

My parents say I am an **optimistic（乐观的）** person who always smiles, but sometimes I can become **stubborn（固执的）** and refuse to listen to others.  
I try to stay **humble（谦虚的）** even when I do well, and I never want to be **selfish（自私的）**.  
Still, like many teenagers, I can be a bit **moody（喜怒无常的）**, especially when I feel tired.

Sometimes, I experience many different **feelings（情感）**.  
I feel **delighted（高兴的）** and **thrilled（兴奋的）** when I win a prize, and I am truly **grateful（感激的）** for the people who support me.  
Before exams, I usually feel **anxious（焦虑的）** and **nervous（紧张的）**, but I feel **relieved（松了一口气的）** after they are over.  
When I fail, I feel **depressed（沮丧的）** and **disappointed（失望的）**, yet I always remind myself to **keep a positive attitude（保持积极的态度）**.  
Once, I forgot my homework and felt terribly **ashamed（羞愧的）**.  
My teacher was kind and **forgave（原谅）** me, which made me feel **touched（感动的）** and **satisfied（满意的）**.

There are times when I feel **embarrassed（尴尬的）** after making a mistake or **frustrated（挫败的）** when things don’t go as planned.  
I also get **bored（无聊的）** during long lessons, but I try to **control my temper（控制脾气）** and stay focused.  
When I feel **lonely（孤独的）**, I talk to my friends who always **cheer me up（使我振作）**.  
Sometimes I feel **jealous（嫉妒的）** of others’ success, but I tell myself to **be proud of（为……感到骄傲）** what I have achieved and to **have confidence in（对……有信心）** my own ability instead of **losing confidence in（对……失去信心）** myself.

I really **admire（欣赏）** people who are brave and kind, and I try to **respect（尊重）** everyone around me.  
When I hurt someone, I **apologize（道歉）** sincerely and try to **comfort（安慰）** them.  
My teachers always **encourage（鼓励）** us to **express our feelings（表达感受）** and **care about others（关心他人）**.  
We learn to **show respect for（表示尊重）** different opinions and **trust（信任）** our friends.  
Even when we **complain（抱怨）** or **blame（责备）** someone, we must do it politely and be ready to **forgive（原谅）**.

In my opinion, a person’s **personality（性格）** and **emotions（情绪）** make them unique.  
No one is perfect, but by being **honest（诚实的）**, **kind（善良的）**, and **considerate（体贴的）**, we can all become better people.  
I will continue to **stay optimistic（保持乐观）**, **be responsible（有责任感）**, and work hard to become a more **confident（自信的）**, **humble（谦虚的）**, and **generous（慷慨的）** person.  
I’m truly **proud of（为……感到骄傲）** the person I am becoming, and I’ll always **keep a positive attitude（保持积极的态度）** toward life.

# 🏃‍♀️ **A Healthy Lifestyle and the Power of Sports（健康的生活方式与运动的力量）**

To **lead a healthy lifestyle（过健康的生活方式）**, we should **keep a balanced diet（保持均衡饮食）** and **do regular exercise（定期运动）**.  
Eating **nutritious（有营养的）** food gives us energy, while avoiding **junk food（垃圾食品）** helps prevent **obesity（肥胖）**.  
We should also drink water to **stay hydrated（保持水分）**, eat enough **protein（蛋白质）**, **vitamins（维他命）** and **carbohydrates（碳水化合物）**,  
and get **enough sleep（充足睡眠）** to avoid **sleep deprivation（睡眠不足）**.  
Counting **calories（卡路里）** and watching our **portion（食物份量）** help us not to **consume（摄取）** too much sugar or fat.  
A healthy **lifestyle（生活方式）** keeps our **immune system（免疫系统）** strong and prevents **disease（疾病）**.

Exercise is just as important as diet. Doing sports improves both **physical fitness（身体健康/体能）** and **mental health（心理健康）**,  
helps us **release stress（释放压力）**, and **boost the immune system（增强免疫系统）**.  
I often **take exercise（锻炼）** and **work out（健身）** with my friends.  
Our **coach（教练）** teaches us to **stretch（伸展）** before **training（训练）** and to **cool down（放松）** afterwards to avoid **injury（受伤）**.  
He also reminds us to do a short **warm-up（热身）** to protect our **muscles（肌肉）** and improve **flexibility（柔韧性）** and **stamina（耐力）**.  
Through regular practice, we **build up strength（增强体力）**, **improve（提升）** our **endurance（持久力）**,  
and **develop healthy habits（养成健康习惯）** that help us **stay in shape（保持体形）** and **keep fit（保持健康）**.

Last month, our school **athletes（运动员）** **took part in（参加）** an inter-school **tournament（联赛）**.  
Although we were nervous at first, our team stayed **determined（有决心的）** and never **gave up（放弃）**.  
After weeks of **training（训练）**, we finally became **champions（冠军）** and even entered the **championship（冠军赛）**.  
The **competition（比赛）** helped me **build self-confidence（建立自信）** and understand the value of teamwork.  
We used proper **equipment（器材）** and always followed safety rules to **prevent（预防）** **injuries（受伤）**.

A **healthy lifestyle（健康的生活方式）** isn’t only about the body—it’s also about the mind.  
When I feel tired or **suffer from（患上）** stress, I take a walk or play basketball to **burn calories（燃烧卡路里）** and **release stress（释放压力）**.  
Exercise helps me **recover（恢复）** from fatigue and stay **optimistic（乐观的）**.  
Once, I hurt my leg but **recovered from（从……康复）** the **injury（伤势）** quickly thanks to physiotherapy.  
My teachers always **encourage（鼓励）** us **to** take sports seriously and to **strengthen（强化）** our **muscles（肌肉）** through daily **training（训练）**.

We should also **cut down on（减少）** sugary drinks and junk food, and **avoid junk food（避免垃圾食品）** to protect our bodies.  
Sports teach us to be **self-disciplined（自律的）**, **confident（自信的）**, and strong-minded.  
When we **participate in（参加）** **competitions（比赛）**, we learn teamwork, perseverance, and respect.  
By doing this, we can **maintain mental health（保持心理健康）** and a positive attitude towards life.  
If we all **lead a healthy lifestyle（过健康的生活）**, stay active, and **keep a balanced diet（保持均衡饮食）**,  
we will have the strength and happiness to face every challenge in life.
