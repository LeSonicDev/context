Search for the past 24 hours’ high‑impact AI/hi‑tech events and produce a concise brief with sources and tickers. Apply the following rules before including an item:

SOURCES (priority order): Bloomberg, WSJ, FT, Reuters, The Information, Semianalysis, TechCrunch, The Verge; company blogs/press rooms; SEC filings; arXiv/official papers; major conference keynotes (e.g., Google I/O, Meta Connect, Apple events); credible regulatory sites (U.S./EU/China). Cross‑check at least two independent sources when possible.

INCLUSION CRITERIA (must meet ≥1):
1) Technical/Research: new model/agent/infra with measurable or peer‑reviewed advancement (benchmarks, latency/throughput, cost per token, context length, multimodal capability, safety evaluation). 
2) Product/Platform: launches or major upgrades likely to shift user growth, distribution, or ecosystem incentives. 
3) Capital/Corporate: M&A, funding ≥$100M, divestiture, leadership change (CEO/CTO), supply chain/compute deals (NVIDIA/AMD/TSMC/cloud) with revenue/CapEx impact. 
4) Market Shock: stock price move ≥5% or unusual volume linked to a specific AI/tech catalyst. 
5) Policy/Regulation: new law, enforcement, export controls, antitrust actions, or tax changes materially affecting AI compute/data/business models.

EXCLUSION (unless they trigger market shock or meet other criteria): routine feature updates, small customer wins, fundraising < $100M, uncorroborated rumors.

CLASSIFY each included item into one: {Technical breakthrough | Product/strategy | Capital/Corp action | Market shock | Policy/Reg}. 

FOR EACH ITEM provide:
- Headline (one line) + [TICKERS] involved (e.g., NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMD, AVGO, ARM, AAPL, AMZN, CRWD, SNOW, DDOG, PLTR) and relevant private names (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek). 
- What changed (facts only, 2–3 bullets). 
- Strategic impact (1–2 bullets): moat, distribution, switching costs, partner ecosystem, regulatory risk. 
- Valuation lens (1–2 bullets): revenue/cost drivers, attach to segments (search, ads, cloud, enterprise AI, chips), magnitude/order of impact, near‑term vs. 12–24m. 
- Evidence: 1–3 links to primary/authoritative sources.

AGGREGATE SECTION at end:
- Market tape: notable moves by sector (chips, cloud, consumer internet, enterprise software) and key factor drivers. 
- Actionable watchlist: 3–5 tickers with one‑line thesis each (Buy/Hold/Watch) tied to today’s events. 
- What to monitor next: concrete triggers (product ship dates, regulatory milestones, supply constraints, earnings).

Tone: crisp, investment‑grade. If no items qualify, say “No qualifying major events in the last 24h” and list near‑miss items briefly with reason for exclusion.
