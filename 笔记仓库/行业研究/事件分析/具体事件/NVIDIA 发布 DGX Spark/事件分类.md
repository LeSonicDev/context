  "Analysis Rationale": {
      "Macro_Rationale": "Based on contextual knowledge of the period, the global economy in late 2025 is classified as Mid-Cycle Expansion, characterized by stable growth and continued elevated technology investment.",
      "Meso_Rationale": "Based on contextual knowledge of the industry, the AI accelerator market is in a Growth phase, with high capital intensity (Low threat of new entrants) and high bargaining power among hyperscale Buyers. The bargaining power of key suppliers, such as TSMC for advanced silicon manufacturing, is rated as High due to the high concentration and criticality of these inputs for cutting-edge AI hardware. The GICS classification is set to the most specific standard entry.",
      "Micro_Rationale": "The event is classified as a 'New Product Launch' within the 'Product & Technology' domain because the text explicitly states the company '首次重大披露（FSD）了其新产品DGX Spark' (made its first significant disclosure (FSD) of its new product DGX Spark). The Strategic Intent is 'Product Line Expansion' targeting a new use case, justified by the device's purpose: '该设备旨在将强大的AI开发能力从大型数据中心下放至边缘和开发者的桌面' (The device is intended to move powerful AI development capabilities from large data centers down to the edge and developer desktops). The 'Event Window Context' is confirmed as '2025年10月14日'."
